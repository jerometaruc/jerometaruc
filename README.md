### Hello, I'm Jerome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria, passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and build things that make life a little easier (or more fun).

Lately, I've been diving deep into **full-stack development**, working on personal projects that help me learn by doing. Whether itâ€™s trying out a new framework or deploying something end-to-end, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge.

When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, youâ€™ll find me at the **climbing gym**, **lifting weights**, or **playing games with friends**. Iâ€™m always looking to learn, connect, and collaborate, so feel free to reach out.
